# What is this project about?

Well... I created a website about the astronomy picture of the day that should update everyday without me doing anything... HOW? Using APIs :)

I used the Nasa's Astronomy picture of the day API and rendered in a streamlit website, which I deployed and now anyone can watch it here :https://e23uvel28ohikafbbkthaj.streamlit.app/

Feel free to watch it, it is not the most awesomely designed website but I think it is the first time I consider that APIs are cool.
